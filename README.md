- Forked git repo
- Cloned git repo to S9 environment
- Deleted .elasticbeanstalk folder
- Changed buildspec, and makefile to match proper application and environment names
- Created and sourced python virtual environment
- Ran and tested "application.py"
- Initialized eb application
- ran eb create
    - As seen in the demo video the eb engine encounters an error while attempting to build the environment. I have found no way to overcome this error.
